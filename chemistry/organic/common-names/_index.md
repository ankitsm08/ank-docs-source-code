## Organic Chemistry: Common Names

Common names are often used colloquially and in everyday life but lack a systematic approach like IUPAC nomenclature. These seemingly arbitrary names can hinder your understanding and ability to solve problems, as exam questions may use common names that you might not be familiar with. To overcome this, it's essential to familiarize yourself with common names and their corresponding structures.

### PDFs

1. [**Common Names Google Drive Collection**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-ujfrDClswEaN8Iy11gN80ieoRY1N614):
   -  PDFs I collected that included common names and their corresponding structures.
   (Sorry, but I didn't consider noting the sources of some of these PDFs at that time.)

### Online Courses

1. [Khan Academy Organic Chemistry Course](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/organic-chemistry):
   - Khan Academy is the best. (*My favourite*)

### Websites

1. [IUPAC Nomenclature of Organic Compounds](https://www.acdlabs.com/iupac/nomenclature/):
   - Full text explaination of IUPAC Nomenclature of Organic Compounds.

## Memorization Techniques

To effectively memorize common names, try these strategies:

1. **Spaced Repetition:** 
   - Revise common names at increasing intervals to reinforce your memory.
2. **Associations:** 
   - Link common names to familiar objects or concepts to enhance recall.
3. **Flashcards:** (Totally Optional)
   - Create flashcards with common names on one side and structures on the other. Try out [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) if you wanna make them digitally.
